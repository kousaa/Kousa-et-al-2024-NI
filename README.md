## Emergence of atypical epithelial features with age limit thymic function at baseline and after injury

### Abstract 

The thymus is essential for establishing adaptive immunity; however, thymic function declines with age which can compromise responsiveness to new antigens.  The thymus is also extremely sensitive to acute stressors and, although it has considerable capacity for endogenous repair, this ability declines with age. Using single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, lineage-tracing approaches and advanced imaging techniques, we discovered two atypical thymic epithelial cell (TEC) populations that emerged with age. These age-associated (aa)TECs formed high-density epithelial clusters that were devoid of thymocytes and thus represented an accumulation of non-functional thymic tissue with age. In silico interaction analysis among key stromal cell populations revealed that the emergence of aaTEC drew tonic signals from TECs at baseline. Following acute injury, aaTEC expanded substantially which may further limit the regeneration of the involuted thymus. These findings define a new population of TEC with considerable implications for our understanding of immune aging and recovery from treatments such as chemotherapy and bone marrow transplant.
